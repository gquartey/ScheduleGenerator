Welcome to the PDF Reader Prototype. 
In the main file here we demonstrate how to read from an existing PDf using the ApachePDFBox library. 
This is an example of how we will be able to read from user transcripts determine the classes they 
have already taken and also read from the course catalog to fina all of the classes offered.
Go [here](https://github.swarthmore.edu/CS71-F17/group-starfruit/blob/master/prototypes/PDFReaderPrototype/src/main/java/PDFManager.java) if you'd like to see the process in which we produce a string from the PDF file.
