# Starfruit's vision for a Swarthmore schedule generator
We will develop a web-based user interface that allows Swarthmore students to input their relevant academic information (such as major, minor, academic interests, and previous classes) and will produce a potential schedule that fulfills all of their graduation requirements as outlined on the Swarthmore website (if possible). In the case where course times are not provided on the school website, we will suggest courses that fulfil requirements and ignore time conflicts). The goal of our application is to provide students with an easy to use tool to map out their academic journey while at Swarthmore.
